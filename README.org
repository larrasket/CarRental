[[file:demo.mp4][Telegram client demo]]
* Content
The source code contains various separated projects that maintain all of the software
services and contains a generic Telegram interface bot client. There is also a Python directory
which is [[file:Merge/][Merge/]], it contains a simple scripted used to merge built reports from
[[file:DataReporter/ReportBuilder.cs][DataReporter/ReportBuilder]].

Currently, the only implemented client is [[file:Telegram/][Telegram]], using Telegram's official APIs.

* Deployment
To deploy the app without containerization, you must have a ~~/Merge~ directory in your
server contains the mentioned Python script, and you need to install the following
dependencies:
#+begin_src shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install openpyxl
#+end_src

For now there is no need for NginX or any web server. Just install the database server,
PostgreSQl:

#+begin_src shell
sudo apt install wget ca-certificates
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
#+end_src

Ensure that the services is running correctly:

#+begin_src shell
service postgresql status
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

If you are going to use a systemd unit, you want to check ~DOTNET_CLI_HOME~ variable. Also
move the Merge directory to root's home, since it will be runing at root. And install
openpyxl again as root.
